# Understanding Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, primarily used for pattern matching with strings. Regular expressions can be used for searching, extracting, and manipulating text.

## Basic Components of Regular Expressions

### Literal Characters
- **Literal Characters**: Match the exact characters.
  - Example: The regex `abc` matches the string "abc".

### Metacharacters
Special characters with specific meanings:
- `.`: Matches any single character except newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of a string.
- `$`: Matches the end of a string.
- `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding element.
- `[]`: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets (character class).
- `()`: Groups part of the regex together and creates a capturing group.
- `|`: Acts as a logical OR.

### Character Classes: []
- `[abc]`: Matches any one of the characters a, b, or c.
- `[a-z]`: Matches any one character from a to z.
- `[^abc]`: Matches any character except a, b, or c., '^' used inside [] so negate the set

### Quantifiers
- `{n}`: Matches exactly n occurrences.
- `{n,}`: Matches n or more occurrences.
- `{n,m}`: Matches between n and m occurrences.

### Escape Sequences
Special sequences for common classes of characters:
- `\d`: Matches any digit (0-9).
- `\D`: Matches any non-digit.
- `\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
- `\W`: Matches any non-word character.
- `\s`: Matches any whitespace character.
- `\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.

## Examples and Use Cases

### Example 1: Basic Matching
```javascript
const regEx1 = () => { 
  const str = 'hello';  
  const regex = /e/;
  return regex.test(str);
};
console.log(regEx1()); // Output: true
```
Explanation:
- `/e/` searches for the character 'e' in the string "hello".
- The test method returns `true` because 'e' is found in "hello".

### Example 2: Using Dot `.`
```javascript
const str = 'hello';
const regex = /.e.lo/;
const res = regex.test(str); 
console.log(res); // Output: true
```
Explanation:
- `.` matches any single character.
- `/h.llo/` matches 'hello' because the dot matches 'e'.

### Example 3: Anchors `^` and `$`
```javascript
const str = 'hello';
const regex = /^h..l.$/;
const res = regex.test(str); 
console.log(res); // Output: true
```
Explanation:
- `^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `$` asserts the position at the end of the string.
- `h..l.` matches 'hello'.

### Example 4: Using `.*`
```javascript
const str = 'hello';
const regEx = /h.*/;
const res = regEx.test(str); 
console.log(res); // Output: true
```
Explanation:
- `.*` matches 0 or more occurrences of any character.
- `/h.*/` matches 'hello' starting from 'h' to the end.

### Lookahead: `/(?=.*[...])/`
Ensures the presence of certain patterns in the string without consuming them.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const regEx = /^(?=.*[a-z])[a-z]{2,}$/;
  ```

## Key Concepts Recap
1. **Anchors**: `^` and `$` ensure the pattern matches the entire string from start to end.
2. **Lookaheads**: `(?=.*[a-z])` checks for the presence of specific characters without consuming them.
3. **Character Classes**: `[A-Za-z\d!@#$%^&*()]` define a set of characters to match.
4. **Quantifiers**: `{8,20}` specify the number of times a character set should appear.
5. **Special Characters and Escaping**: `\d`, `!@#$%^&*()` match digits and special characters.
6. **Combining Multiple Conditions**: Using lookaheads to ensure the presence of various character types.

### Difference Between `+` and `{m,n}`
- `+`: Repeats the matching work from 1 occurrence to more than one.
- `{m,n}`: Matches between m and n occurrences.

Example:
```javascript
const regExPlus = /^[A-Za-z\d]+\@[A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]+$/;
const str1 = 'example@mail.com';
const res = regExPlus.test(str1);
console.log(res); // Output: true
```
